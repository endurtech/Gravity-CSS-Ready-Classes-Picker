## Description

> This WordPress plugin for Gravity Forms will allow you to quickly and conveniently select from a fully updated list of CSS Ready Classes available under your form fields' Appearance tab. This plugin is a modified version of [Brad's Gravity Forms CSS Ready Class Selector WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/gravity-forms-css-ready-selector/). Special thanks to [Brad Vincent](https://profiles.wordpress.org/bradvin/) for the original code and [Mike Kormendy](https://github.com/mkormendy) for the cleaned up version! [Visit the new and improved plugin web site](https://endurtech.com/css-ready-classes-plugin/) for more details.  

> This plugin, as of v2.5, will also HIDE ALL Gravity Forms backend tooltips when managing your forms. Those tooltips are helpful to the uninitiated but quickly become a pest to those of us who are initiated. To restore tooltip function simply disable this plugin. In a future release I will look into embedding this feature into the main Gravity Forms Settings area so that it can be toggled. If anyone wants to help me achieve this please [get in touch with me](https://endurtech.com/contact/).  

> This plugin, as of v2.7.6, will also HIDE ALL Gravity Forms "Required Field Notification" message which appears at the top of every form. That notification is helpful to the uninitiated but quickly become a pest to those of us who are initiated. To restore the notification message at the top of each form simply disable this plugin. In a future release I will look into embedding this feature into the main Gravity Forms Settings area so that it can be toggled. If anyone wants to help me achieve this please [get in touch with me](https://endurtech.com/contact/).
